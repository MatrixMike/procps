It appears that watch.c is present but not compiled in the make. I would like to address this issue.
Also need to discover why cppcheck reports unused variables but when I remove them the compiler complains that they are not present...

need to add a .gitignore to prevent executable files from being uploaded

Find manual compile for free 
<some tests being done on LM Maya? (13) >
free would be really useful on older laptops with questionable (size) memory cards
